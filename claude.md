# Bash commands

# Code style
## Python

- alphabetize imports

## Typescript

# Workflow
- Be sure to typecheck when youâ€™re done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
- Before writing any code, write a plan.md in the plans folder for a feature
- Omit performance testing and advanced security from plans. Features should be performant, but we won't performance test them with agents. We want features to be secure but we don't need advanced security testing.
