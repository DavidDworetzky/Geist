# Platz
FOSS Project for natural language AI Assistants - using GPT, LlaMA, FLAN etc. architectures.
Platz is an environment for multiple natural language AI Assistants to interact, train, and do work.

#Roadmap
1. Create core OODA architecture for AI Assistants using various LLM transformer architectures.
2. Create core API surface area for inference for architectures.
3. Persist conversations, memory, and presets for various agents and feed these back into agent startup / initialization.
4. Create external world adapters for agents to interact with the real world, such as VoIP, Slack, Notion, etc.
